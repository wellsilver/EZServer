# EZServer
Remember to download from "Releases"
### TO START THE SERVER, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS IN APP
### TO CONNECT TO THE SERVER, TYPE "localhost" IN IP ADDRESS BAR (Where you put hypixel.net, mineplex.net)


### How it works

First of all, all neccesary files are placed in appdata (you may recognize this from modding normal minecraft, it is where apps put their data, lol)

Using bitsadmin the EULA (Pre filled out, you agree to it by starting the server) .jar and serverproperties (So .jar doesnt create a new EULA)

Then it places some information before running the "java" command to start the server

### Soon

Paper and other builds (to allow plugins)

Full plugin suite (possible but I dont know if forge/spigot has the neccessary API's or conveniently setup file links)

Decide amount of ram

Community translations? (Submit a pull request, lol)

### Known bugs

I havent tested if this is actually a problem yet, but if you start a version incompatible with the server.properties it may create a new one,
this might not be a problem for some time.

If enough people download the server.jar it may be a issue, I used up 2% of the (free hosting lol) monthly bandwith just testing the program

Timeout.exe (A built in windows proccess) when called by a .exe sets off some anti viruses, sadly there is no easy workaround however you are free to submit one in issues or implement it yourself with a pull request
