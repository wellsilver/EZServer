# EZServer
Remember to download from "Releases"

### TO CONNECT TO THE SERVER, TYPE "localhost" IN IP ADDRESS BAR (Where you put hypixel.net, mineplex.net)


### How it works

First of all, all neccesary files are placed in appdata (you may recognize this from modding normal minecraft, it is where apps put their data, lol)

Using wget the EULA (Pre filled out, you agree to it by starting the server) .jar and serverproperties (So .jar doesnt create a new EULA) are downloaded

Then it places some information before running the "java" command to start the server

### Graphical rewrite

After I finish the next update to EZServer (99%) I will start work on a rewrite in python with *graphics*
